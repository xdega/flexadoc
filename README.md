# Flexadoc

A documentation platform designed to link GitHub with a user-friendly frontend (typically Markdown). This attempts to solve the age-old business problem of "where should documentation live?"

Perhaps the answer is that this shouldn't be a compromise, but instead an aggregation that is **_flexible_** to the needs of a team/project.

## Development Setup and Start

1. Add a .env file with the following (project root):

- `AUTH_SECRET` (Random 32 character key)
- `GITHUB_ID` (Github OAuth project ID)
- `GITHUB_SECRET` (Github OAuth project secret)

2. Bun Install
3. Bun Run Dev
